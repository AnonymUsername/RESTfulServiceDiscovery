This source code is used to implement an automatic K-Resource discovery solution for hybrid Web connected environments providing linked static resources and connecting dynamic resources.
The code also contains developments related to the comparison between BFS and DFS algorithms, and to the performance evaluation of the construction of the indexing schema linking the resources to their provided functions.

* Dependencies:
- flask
- flask_restful

Examples of the necessary commands are in the 'curl commands examples' file

P.S. Before executing any command, the user should create:
- 4 empty folder having respectively the following names: ‘static’, ‘dynamic’, ‘virtual’, and ‘init_static’ (these are used to store the created resources)
- 4 empty python files '.py' having respectively the following names: 'from.py', 'appregister.py', 'infrom.py', and 'inappregister.py' (such files store the references of the created resources that will be included in the server: 'server.py' file)
