This source code is used to implement an automatic K-Resource discovery solution based on a BFS-algorithm.
The code also contains developments related to the comparison of BFS and DFS, and to the performance evaluation of the construction of the indexing schema.

* Dependencies:
- flask
- flask_restful

Examples of the necessary commands are in the 'curl commands examples' file

P.S. Before executing any command, the user should create:
4 empty folder having respectively the following names: ‘static’, ‘dynamic’, ‘virtual’, and ‘init_static’ (these are used to stode the created rsources)
4 empty python files '.py' having respectively the following names: 'from.py', 'appregister.py', 'infrom.py', and 'inappregister.py' (such files store the references of the created resources that will be included in the server: 'server.py' file
